                        The women’s study lounge in the Union <a href="http://statenews.com/article/2016/08/womens-lounge-title-ix" target="_blank">closed</a> this summer after opening in 1925.
                        <br><br>
						MSU spokesman Jason Cody said concerns of Title IX violations were brought forward regarding the lounge and several factors contributed to the decision of its closing.
						<br><br>
						Cody said MSU’s Title IX office and General Counsel looked into the situation, which lead to the decision to turn the women’s study lounge into an all-gender space. 
						<br><br>
						The State News sat down with four MSU students to discuss the importance of the women’s study lounge, challenges women face on college campuses as well as their take on Title IX.
						<br><br>
						The State News encourages other students to come forward with their stories and opinions on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesnews/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

                            For doctoral student Apryl Pooley, the women’s study lounge was a place of refuge.
                            <br><br>
							Pooley was raped twice while at Eastern Illinois University, where she received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees. She suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after she was assaulted and couldn’t escape her attacker even though he was hundreds of miles away.
							<br><br>
							“I would just feel his presence, I would just see him everywhere,” Pooley said. “But going into the women's study lounge it was just like an immediate relief. I knew he wasn't there."
							<br><br>
							Pooley came to MSU in 2011 and discovered the lounge during her first or second week of classes, she said. Although she knew her attacker was not at MSU, there were times she still didn’t feel safe.
							<br><br>
							"When I was on campus and I was triggered or maybe having a flashback or feeling panicked for whatever reason, that (the women’s study lounge) was a place that I knew I could go and feel safe,” Pooley said.
							<br><br>
							During her first year at MSU, Pooley said she began “an amazing” recovery process. She said she found a therapist, counselor and other resources through MSU that helped her heal from her sexual assaults.
							<br><br>
							Pooley said her recovery would have not been possible without the women’s resource center, the women’s study lounge and other resources through MSU, but she is concerned for what the future may look like.
							<br><br>
							"I feel so worried for people that might be coming to campus in a position that i was five years ago, who now don't have those resources available,” Pooley said.
							<br><br>
							She said the decision to close the lounge shows the administration is out of touch.
							<br><br>
							"It shows that MSU doesn't understand or doesn't care about the struggles that women face on their campus,” Pooley said. “If they don't understand than I don't know why they aren't listening. There's plenty of people talking."

                            When Zoology senior Alyse Maksimoski heard the women’s study lounge was closing she took action.
                            <br><br>
							What started as a Facebook event, in which Maksimoski invited a few of her friends, has turned into a sit-in protest at the Union with over 530 people confirmed to be going on Facebook and an almost additional 500 people interested in the event.
							<br><br>
							Maksimoski said she planned the event to show the university how crucial the lounge is.
							<br><br>
							"Women's spaces are still very important because women face discrimination and we face different issues than men,” Maksimoski said. “That may sound a little harsh, but it's true."
							<br><br>
							Maksimoski said women are catcalled and whistled at on campus and have to worry about being sexually assaulted.
							<br><br>
							"Before MSU says we need to treat women equally, they need to treat women equitably and recognize the aspects in which we are discriminated against and we are oppressed and we feel marginalized and validate that before they completely dismiss it and say men and women are exactly the same,” Maksimoski said.
							<br><br>
							Maksimoski also took issue with the timing of the decision to close the women’s study lounge.
							<br><br>
							"It just astounds me that there are all these actions being taken in the summer when there are hardly any students around,” Maksimoski. “I think that's a very strategic move and you kind of see the true colors of the university.”
							<br><br>
							Maksimoski had one more message for the administration.
							<br><br>
							"Give us back our study lounge,” Maksimoski said.

                            A feeling women have on campus at MSU is insecurity, art education senior Zoë LeBlanc de Smith said.
                            <br><br>
							Smith said women have to be on high alert to protect themselves and are constantly stared at while on college campuses. The women’s study lounge was one spot Smith said she didn’t have to put up with it.
							<br><br>
							“You walk in the door and there was a sense of relief that overcomes you and you can just relax,” Smith said. “You don't have to be aware of everything around you, you don't have to worry about someone staring at you or approaching you."
							<br><br>
							Smith said it seems like MSU is going backwards instead of forwards with the decision to close the women’s study lounge.
							<br><br>
							"They are not focused on people who are disadvantaged and people who really need an extra push,” Smith said. “Women face different challenges in society and that's obvious with sexual harassment and rape.”
							<br><br>
							Smith said she has made her opinion on the closing of the lounge heard on social media and plans to attend an upcoming sit-in protest at the Union. She said the women’s study lounge is very necessary and believes Title IX was put into place to help people with disadvantages.
							<br><br>
							"I feel like the whole purpose behind Title IX law is because women are discriminated against more than men and that we see that as a society and we are trying to help people who are disadvantaged,” Smith said. “By having this room it's not taking away any rights from men, it's just helping the women to get a leg up."

                            “I was driving in my car and there was a police officer right next to me,” journalism junior Amber Rasberry said. 
                            <br><br>
                            Rasberry said she noticed the police officer staring at her and driving at the same speed as her.
                            <br><br>
                            “Why is she staring at me? What am I doing wrong?” Rasberry said in response to the officer’s behavior.
                            <br><br>
                            Rasberry tried to ignore the officer.
                            <br><br>
                            “I get to a red light, she’s next to me and the car who’s in front of me, who was a white male, drove past and ran the red light,” Rasberry said. “But she was staring at me, so she didn’t even notice that he ran the red light.”
                            <br><br>
                            Once she was pulled over, Rasberry said she was not issued a ticket.
                            <br><br>
                            “(She) just wanted to basically bother me for nothing, when she could have had someone who actually ran a red light," Rasberry said. "It was just, ‘Wow, what I am doing so wrong, why am I being targeted?’”

                            Political theory and constitutional democracy senior Jovan Pillow-Harmon has experienced racism frequently at sporting and social events.
                            <br><br>
                            “I was leaving a football game and we were tailgating and what not and some people just screamed ‘n-----’ out the window, like a hard ‘r,'” Pillow-Harmon said. 
                            <br><br>
                            Pillow-Harmon said he thinks of ignorance when he reflects on the incident.
                            <br><br>
                            “His friends apologized for him, but he never apologized,” Pillow-Harmon said. “That’s actually happened to me more than once.”
                            <br><br>
                            He said when he goes to social events with a larger crowd of his black friends, people give a certain look.
                            <br><br>
                            "Black people may have a lot of negative stigmas about us, where we're going to go somewhere and raise hell and tear your house up," Pillow-Harmon said.
