				<h2>Investigation finds MSU mishandled sexual assault cases</h2>
				<p>The United States Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights came to the conclusion that MSU did not resolve two separate sexual assault cases quickly enough in accordance to OCR mandates — the findings came after a year-and-a-half investigation from the Office of Civil Rights. After the announcement, MSU released a list of steps it planned to take to improve the timeliness of sexual assault case investigations.</p>

				<p>One of the findings from the Office of Civil Rights’  investigation into MSU sexual assault policy was of an MSU counselor who was accused of sexually harassing students who were seeking counseling after being sexually assaulted. After no action was allegedly taken against the counselor after the first incident, MSU launched a Title IX investigation into the accusations after more people filed reports against the counselor in 2013. When the investigation began the counselor was removed from contact with students and relieved of clinical responsibilities while the investigation was ongoing.</p>

				<h2>7 quotes from President Simon on sexual assault, student services, and more</h2>
				<p>MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon came to speak with various State News reporter and editors about sexual assault and other topics concerning MSU students. Simon also addressed the current state of MSU’s intramural sports facilities, which are not as nice as many of the other IM facilities in the Big Ten. Simon said there was money in MSU’s budget for facilities improvements, but added caution saying she would prefer a new facility be built rather than updates done to current facilities that would need upgrades again after just a couple years.</p>

				<p>With a 24-21 victory over Purdue last fall, then-senior quarterback Connor Cook passed former MSU quarterback and current starting quarterback for the Washington Redskins Kirk Cousins for most wins as a quarterback at MSU with 28. Cook made his big debut in MSU’s 2012 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl 17-16 win over TCU, where he led MSU on a game-winning drive.

				<h2>Cook on wild victory: "Honestly, it just felt like a dream"</h2>
				<p>On a brisk Saturday afternoon in Ann Arbor it happened — one of the craziest endings in college football history as MSU defeated U-M 27-23 for MSU’s third straight win over its in-state rival and seven wins in the past eight games. With 10 seconds to play the game looked all but over. U-M was set to punt the ball away and watch the clock run out which would have given first year coach Jim Harbaugh a critical win over MSU. However, the U-M punter fumbled the snap and then attempted to kick the ball while being tackled. The ball popped right into the hands of redshirt freshman defensive back Jalen Watts-Jackson, who returned the fumble for a TD as time expired. Watts-Jackson missed the rest of the season due to a broken hip suffered on the final play, which required surgery. The win came after earlier in the week U-M supporters vandalized the Earvin "Magic" Johnson statue outside of Breslin Center.</p>

				<h2>MSU defeats Ohio State on last second field goal, 17-14</h2>
				<p>MSU rolled into Columbus, Ohio for its monumental showdown against Ohio State with a loss meaning essentially no chance at a division title and trip to the Big Ten title game and a win allowing MSU to control its own destiny needing to only win its final game at home against Penn State to secure a trip to the Big Ten title game.
